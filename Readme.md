# Snapcook - Bangkit 2023 Capstone Project

"AGEMAN" is an innovative project designed to tackle the challenge of dwindling interest among the younger generation in Balinese traditional dance. Through the integration of dance scan features and interactive dancer workshops, our aim is to both preserve and promote Bali's rich cultural heritage. The decline in interest stems from a lack of accessible resources for understanding and appreciating Balinese dance, coupled with limited opportunities for hands-on engagement.

## Our Mission

agemana aims to achieve one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by promoting Balinese culture to the public and tourists. With a community-based approach, our ageman platform has the potential to grow in the future, with scan features and workshop features with this feature making it easier to introduce Balinese and Indonesian culture to be easily recognized by the world.

## Our Solutions

An Android application that can provide an introduction to Balinese dance culture based on dance photos taken by users. This application can provide an explanation of the dance and workshops with ease for users.
